### Commercial Version Running in Parallel
Proma also offers a commercial version. If you need **cloud features** | **stable and reliable API** | **cost-effective subscription plans** | **simple user experience**, you're welcome to support the commercial version of Proma: https://proma.cool/download — subscription plans start at 40% of official pricing.

The core vision of Proma is not to replace any particular software. Currently, only the infrastructure of Proma has been implemented. Going forward, Proma will continue to build multi-agent collaboration (personal and team), agent connections with external services, Tools and Skills consolidation, and the ability to proactively provide software and suggestions based on user understanding and memory. Proma is evolving rapidly with the help of VibeCoding tools. PRs are welcome!

### Agent Teams
Agent Teams (or Agent Swarm) is one of the major development directions for agents in 2026. Proma already supports Agent Teams, which can automatically assemble teams based on task complexity. In practice, this improves complex task handling by at least 5%–20%. When running Agent Teams, you'll see each agent's working status on the right panel. (You can also request Agent Teams via natural language and assign each agent a specific work or research scope.)

Built-in Brainstorming and office suite Skills with MCP support. Automatically helps you find and install Skills through conversation.

## Getting Started

Download the latest release for your platform:

**[Download Proma](https://github.com/ErlichLiu/Proma/releases)**

## Configuration

### Adding a Channel

Go to **Settings > Channels**, click **Add Channel**, select a provider, and enter your API Key. Proma will auto-fill the correct API endpoint. Click **Test Connection** to verify, then **Fetch Models** to load available models.

### Agent Mode (Anthropic Only)

Agent mode requires an **Anthropic** channel. After adding one, go to **Settings > Agent** to select your Anthropic channel and preferred model (Claude Sonnet 4 / Opus 4 recommended). The agent uses [Claude Agent SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk) under the hood.

### Special Provider Endpoints

MiniMax, Kimi (Moonshot), and Zhipu GLM use dedicated API endpoints — these are auto-configured when you select the provider. All three support their **programming membership plans** for API access:

| Provider | Chat Mode | Agent Mode | Note |
|----------|----------|----------|------|
| MiniMax | `https://api.minimaxi.com/v1` | `https://api.minimaxi.com/anthropic`| Supports MiniMax Pro membership |
| Kimi | `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1` | `https://api.moonshot.cn/anthropic`| Supports Moonshot developer plan |
| Zhipu GLM | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4` | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic`| Supports Zhipu developer plan |
