### Commercial Version Running in Parallel
RV-Insights also offers a commercial version.

### Agent Teams
Agent Teams (or Agent Swarm) is one of the major development directions for agents in 2026. RV-Insights already supports Agent Teams, which can automatically assemble teams based on task complexity. In practice, this improves complex task handling by at least 5%–20%. When running Agent Teams, you'll see each agent's working status on the right panel. (You can also request Agent Teams via natural language and assign each agent a specific work or research scope.)

## Getting Started

Download the latest release for your platform:

**[Download RV-Insights](https://github.com/ErlichLiu/RV-Insights/releases)**

## Configuration

### Adding a Channel

Go to **Settings > Channels**, click **Add Channel**, select a provider, and enter your API Key. RV-Insights will auto-fill the correct API endpoint. Click **Test Connection** to verify, then **Fetch Models** to load available models.

### Agent Mode (Anthropic Only)

Agent mode requires an **Anthropic** channel. After adding one, go to **Settings > Agent** to select your Anthropic channel and preferred model (Claude Sonnet 4 / Opus 4 recommended). The agent uses [Claude Agent SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk) under the hood.

### Special Provider Endpoints

MiniMax, Kimi (Moonshot), and Zhipu GLM use dedicated API endpoints — these are auto-configured when you select the provider. All three support their **programming membership plans** for API access:

| Provider | Chat Mode | Agent Mode | Note |
|----------|----------|----------|------|
| MiniMax | `https://api.minimaxi.com/v1` | `https://api.minimaxi.com/anthropic`| Supports MiniMax Pro membership |
| Kimi | `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1` | `https://api.moonshot.cn/anthropic`| Supports Moonshot developer plan |
| Zhipu GLM | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4` | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic`| Supports Zhipu developer plan |
