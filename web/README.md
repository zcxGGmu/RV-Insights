# RV-Insights Web

## Overview

This directory contains the static bilingual product homepage for `RV-Insights`.
It is intentionally framework-free for now so the project can ship a polished landing page
before a full frontend application is implemented.

## Local Preview

Run the homepage locally from the repository root:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000 -d web
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).
